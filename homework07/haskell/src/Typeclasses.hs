Typeclasses
-----------

If we let Haskell infer the type of the following function, it will not be
the one we wrote for it in the previous section, but something more general.

-}
  
add :: Num a => a -> a -> a
add = (+)

{- 
The above type tells us that add works for any type, as long as this type
implements the [Num] type class. 

What is a type class?

A type class is a set of operations (functions and constants), can must be
implemented by any type that is an _instance_ of the type class. Type class
defines a common interface 

Then when writing polymorphic functions, one can put constraints on
polymorphic types that they should implement a particular type class. This is
called a type class constraint. Then the function can access all the
operations of the type class.

Haskell implements overloading, which is the ability to define an operation
for more than one types, using type classes. 

The Num typeclass defines operations like +, -, * for numeric types. Every
type that implements the typeclass, i.e., provides an instance of the type
class, should define this operations.

Another useful class is Eq, that defines equality and inequality.
Its definition in Haskell library is the following:


class Eq a where
    (==)        :: a -> a -> Bool
    (/=)        :: a -> a -> Bool

    x /= y      = not (x == y) -- default implementation


The definition of inequality has a default has a default implementation that 
will be used when if the instance does not redefine the operation.

Most build-in datatypes in Haskell provide instances for Eq But when we are
defining our own types, we may want them to provide instances of such
classes.

data Tree a = Leaf | Node a (Tree a) (Tree a)

-- The type class instance for Tree a, has a type class constraint that the
-- type a must implement Eq

instance Eq a => Eq (Tree a) where
    (==) :: Eq a => Tree a -> Tree a -> Bool
    Leaf          == Leaf             = True
    Node a1 t1 t2 == Node a1' t1' t2' = a1 == a1' && t1 == t1' && t2 == t2'
    _             ==                  _ = False 

tree1 :: Tree Int
tree1 = Node 42 (Node 17 Leaf Leaf) Leaf

tree2 :: Tree Int 
tree2 = Node 17 (Node 11 Leaf Leaf) Leaf

--- >>> tree1 == tree2
-- False

--- >>> tree1 == tree1
-- True

-- Haskell lets us use the keyword deriving to automatically derive some
-- instances. In Haskell 98, the only derivable classes are Eq, Ord, Enum, Ix,
-- Bounded, Read, and Show. Various language extensions extend this list.

-- For example:

data Tree' a = Leaf' | Node' a (Tree' a) (Tree' a)
  deriving (Eq, Show)

tree1' :: Tree' Int
tree1' = Node' 42 (Node' 17 Leaf' Leaf') Leaf'

tree2' :: Tree' Int 
tree2' = Node' 17 (Node' 11 Leaf' Leaf') Leaf'

--- >>> tree1' == tree2'
-- False

--- >>> tree1' == tree1'
-- True

-- The Show type class provides one function show :: a -> String that converts
-- its input to a string. 

-- >>> show tree1'
-- "Node' 42 (Node' 17 Leaf' Leaf') Leaf'"

-- These derived instances might not always be the desired ones.

-- For example, consider the following simple AST that contains information
-- about the position of the node in the source code. When we compare
-- expressions, we would like to ignore this.

-- The source code position
type Posn = (Int,Int) -- a type synonym

data Exp = Var Posn String 
         | App Posn Exp Exp
         | Abs Posn String Exp
         | Num Posn Int
         | Add Posn Exp Exp 
   deriving Show

instance Eq Exp where
    (==) :: Exp -> Exp -> Bool
    Var _ x     == Var _ x'      = x == x'
    App _ e1 e2 == App _ e1' e2' = e1 == e1' && e2 == e2'
    Abs _ x e   == Abs _ x' e'   = x == x' && e == e'
    Num _ n     == Num _ n'      = n == n'
    Add _ e1 e2 == Add _ e1' e2' = e1 == e1' && e2 == e2'
    _ == _ = False

-- >>> (Add (0,2) (Num (0,0) 3) (Num (0,4) 4)) == (Add (1,2) (Num (1,0) 3) (Num (1,4) 4))
-- True

-- Another common typeclass is the Ord typeclass that provides comparison
-- functions.

-- Using Ord we can write a generic quicksort function

qsort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a] -- What is Ord?
qsort [] = []
qsort (p:xs) =
  qsort [x | x <- xs, x < p] ++
  [p] ++ qsort [x | x <- xs, x >= p]


{- 

To summarize we've see four very standard type classes in Haskell:

- Ord  : provides total orderings on data types
- Show : allows data types to be printed as strings
- Eq   : provides (in)equality operations
- Num  : provides functionality common to all kinds of numbers

Next, we will move to another very common Haskell typeclass: Monads.

{- 

Monads
------

Monads can be seen as a generic interface to various types of computations.

This interface can be used to simulate an imperative programming style in purely 
functional languages by hiding a lot of . This makes it easier to write code 
that manipulates state, throws errors, models nondeterminism, etc.

Monads can also be used to encapsulate truly impure code and keep it 
separate from the pure language fragment (like the IO monad). 

The interface that must be implemented by a monad is the following. 

class Monad (m :: Type -> Type) where    
  -- encapsulate a pure computation in a monadic one
  return :: a -> m a
  -- sequence two monadic compuations
  (>>=)  :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b

Note, that the monad is not parametric on a type, but a type operator. As we
will see, this can be a List, a Maybe, or a "side-effect" type like IO.

In addition to the interface, monads should satisfy the _monad laws_:

return a >>= k = k a
m >>= return = m 
m >>= (\x -> k x >>= h)  =  (m >>= k) >>= h

Note: As of 2017, Haskell require every Monad to also be an Applicative
instance, and every Applicative to also have a Functor instance. to be 

-}

-- The Maybe Monad

{- The implementation of the Maybe monad, provided by the Haskell standard library 
   is the following:

instance Monad Maybe where
   return      :: a -> Maybe a
   return         =  Just

   (>>=)       :: Maybe a -> (a -> Maybe b) -> Maybe b
   Nothing  >>= _ =  Nothing
   (Just x) >>= f =  f x

-}

-- There is also a "monadic action" specific to this monad
fail :: Maybe a
fail = Nothing

-- We can use the Maybe monad to avoid boilerplate code when writing recursive
-- functions that return optional types. 

-- For example we can write an interpreter for lambda calculus, which is a
-- partial function, without having to explicitly match the result to get it out 
-- of the Maybe type. We can simply use monadic bind to do this.

subst :: String -> Exp -> Exp -> Exp 
subst x t' t@(Var _ y)    = if x == y then t' else t
subst x t' t@(Abs p y t1) = if x == y then t else Abs p y (subst x t' t1)
subst x t' (App p t1 t2)  = App p (subst x t' t1) (subst x t' t2)
subst _ _ t@(Num _ _)     = t
subst x t' (Add p t1 t2)  = Add p (subst x t' t1) (subst x t' t2)

psn :: Posn
psn = (0,0)

exp1 :: Exp
exp1 = subst "x" (Abs psn "z" (Var psn "z")) (App psn (Var psn "x") (Add psn (Num psn 1) (Num psn 2)))

-- >>> exp1
-- App (0,0) (Abs (0,0) "z" (Var (0,0) "z")) (Add (0,0) (Num (0,0) 1) (Num (0,0) 2))

eval (Var _ _) = fail
eval (Abs p x t) = return (Abs p x t)  
eval (App _ t1 t2) = 
  eval t1 >>= (\v -> 
    case v of
      Abs _ x t -> 
        eval t2 >>= (\v2 ->
        eval (subst x v2 t))

    _ -> Nothing))

{-- 

Do notation
-----------

This already feels all lot like sequencing imperative code. Haskell provides a
"do notation" to makes this sequencing feel even more natural. 

A monadic bind operation 

m >>= \x -> m' 

in do notation becomes 

x <- m
m'

This notation, which resembles an imperative program, must be written inside a
do block. The following example demonstrates this.

eval' (Abs p x t) = return (Abs p x t)

Generic Monad Functions 
------------------------

There are several monadic combinators that let us manipulate and sequence monadic computation. 
Some examples are: 

-- Map each element of a structure to a monadic action, evaluate these actions from left to 
-- right, and collect the results. 
mapM :: (Traversable t, Monad m) => (a -> m b) -> t a -> m (t b)

-- Evaluate each monadic action in the structure from left to right, and collect the results. 
sequence :: (Traversable t, Monad m) => t (m a) -> m (t a)

-- Lift a pure function to a monadic one 
liftM :: Monad m => (a1 -> r) -> m a1 -> m r

-- Lift a pure function with two arguments to a monadic one 
liftM2 :: Monad m => (a1 -> a2 -> r) -> m a1 -> m a2 -> m r

The Reader Monad

the context to each call, the context is treated as a global, read-only state.
