{- Property Based Testing
   ======================

Property-based testing is a powerful automatic testing methodology where the
programmer writes program specifications, expressed as boolean predicates. These
specifications are then tested against a large set of randomly generated inputs
to identify potential property violations.

This approach combines benefits from both formal verification and testing:

Formal Specifications: The programmer formally specifies their code, which
enhances understanding and documentation.

Automated Falsification: The specifications are tested automatically, allowing
for quick bug discovery.

While property-based testing alone cannot prove the absolute correctness of a
specification, it is highly effective at exposing flaws, enhancing software
quality, and accelerating the development process.

Property-based random testing was introduced and popularized by QuickCheck [1],
a Haskell library and testing framework that provides combinator for writing
properties and random input generators. Since then, QuickCheck has been ported
to many other languages.

Note: You can find more QuickCheck course material in [2] and [3].

{- Properties
   ---------
Let's start by defining some basic properties for QC to test.


-}

revSingleton :: Integer -> Bool
revSingleton a = reverse [a] == [a]

revAppend :: [Integer] -> [Integer] -> Bool
revAppend xs ys = reverse (xs ++ ys) == reverse ys ++ reverse xs

revAppendWrong :: [Integer] -> [Integer] -> Bool
revAppendWrong xs ys = reverse (xs ++ ys) == reverse xs ++ reverse xs

revInvolutive :: [Integer] -> Bool
revInvolutive xs = reverse (reverse xs) == xs

{- We can then open the REPL and try the following

ghci> quickCheck revSingleton
+++ OK, passed 100 tests.

ghci> quickCheck revAppend
+++ OK, passed 100 tests.

ghci> quickCheck revAppendWrong
*** Failed! Falsified (after 2 tests):
[]
[0]

ghci> quickCheck revInvolutive
+++ OK, passed 100 tests.

-}

{-- Testable
    --------

All four of the above calls type check, which makes us wonder what is the type
of the quickCheck function.

quickCheck :: Testable prop => prop -> IO ()

quickCheck takes as input an instance of the Testable class. This is the class
of properties that QC knows how to test.

It has one function:

property :: prop -> Property

Which test something testable and turns it into the Testable type. Testable is
the type of testable properties in QC.

Let's look at some instances:

-- Of course A Property is testable
Testable Property

-- Bool is trivially testable
Testable Bool

-- If a property is Testable, then a -> prop is testable, provided that the
   input satisfies -- some type class constraints, in particular Show and
   Arbitrary. Show will let QuickCheck print -- counterexamples, if any, and
   Arbitrary is QC's type class for types for which there are random generators.

--  (Arbitrary a, Show a, Testable prop) => Testable (a -> prop)

Internally what this instance does is to generate random inputs for the argument a,
and pass them to the property so that it can be tested.

QC derived properties for all of the function above using the second and third instance.

This can be done with the forAll combinator, as we will see later.

-}


{- More Properties
   ---------------

Let's now try to write more convoluted properties that test an insertion sort implementation.
-}

insert :: Integer -> [Integer] -> [Integer]
insert v []= [v]
insert v (x:xs) | v > x = x : insert v xs
insert v (x:xs) = v : x : xs

insertionSort :: [Integer] -> [Integer]
insertionSort [] = []
insertionSort (x:xs) = insert x (insertionSort xs)

-- >>> insertionSort [7,5,4,3,4]
-- [3,4,4,5,7]

-- We will define and test the properties that our implementation needs to
-- satisfy. One obvious one is the the output of insertionSort must be sorted.

-- We define an isSorted predicate that we use to test the implementation if insertionSort

isSorted :: [Integer] -> Bool
isSorted [] = True
isSorted (x:xs)= aux x xs
 where
    aux _ [] = True
    aux y (z:zs) = y <= z && aux z zs


sortedProp :: ([Integer] -> [Integer]) -> [Integer] -> Bool
sortedProp f = isSorted . f

{- We run:

ghci> quickCheck $ sortedProp insertionSort
+++ OK, passed 100 tests.

That's good. But also, a trivial wrong implementation that always the empty list satisfies this spec.

ghci> quickCheck $ sortedProp (\_ -> [])
-- ... complains about some types ...
+++ OK, passed 100 tests.

Let's try to further refine the output.
-}

lengthProp :: ([Integer] -> [Integer]) -> [Integer] -> Bool
lengthProp f xs = length xs == length (f xs)


{-
ghci> quickCheck $ lengthProp insertionSort
+++ OK, passed 100 tests.

That's better but we can still find a wrong implementation that passes all of this tests.


ghci> quickCheck $ sortedProp (\xs -> repeat 1 (length xs))

-}

bogusSort :: [Integer] -> [Integer]
bogusSort xs = replicate (length xs) 1

-- If you're aiming for more "Haskell-like" brevity (and don’t mind alienating
-- the reader!), you can write the same function using point-free style:

-- bogusSort = flip replicate 1 . length

{- bogusSort passes all the tests, despite being bogus.

ghci> quickCheck $ sortedProp bogusSort
+++ OK, passed 100 tests.

ghci> quickCheck $ lengthProp bogusSort
+++ OK, passed 100 tests.

-}

{-

We need an even more precise property here. We need to test that the output
list, in addition to being sorted,  must contain exactly the same elements as
the input list, including their frequencies

Exercise: Write a property that states that the output of insertionSort is a
permutation of the input. Think about how you can do this efficiently.

-}

{- Conditional Properties
   -----------------------

It is a good idea to also check correctness properties for the insert function.
After all, if we find a bug in insertionSort it may very well be that it is a
bug in the implementation of insert.

We will test that insert preserves the "sortedness" of a list:
if the input list is sorted then the output list after the insertion should also
be sorted.

To do this we must write a conditional property. To do this we uses QC's ==>
combinator.

(==>) :: Testable prop => Bool -> prop -> Property

Note: as above, this does not uniquely determine the output of insert and to test full
functional correctness we must also write more properties.
-}

insertPreservesSorted :: Integer -> [Integer] -> Property
insertPreservesSorted x xs = isSorted xs ==> isSorted (insert x xs)

{-

Let's see what happens.

ghci> quickCheck $ insertPreservesSorted
*** Gave up! Passed only 63 tests; 1000 discarded tests.

QuickCheck reports that 63 tests passed but the rest was discarded. We can try
to increase the number of tests that QC runs, using the combinator withMaxSuccess.

-- Configures how many times a property will be tested.
withMaxSuccess ::  forall prop. Testable prop => Int -> prop -> Property


-}

quickCheckN :: (Testable prop) => Int -> prop -> IO ()
quickCheckN n = quickCheck . withMaxSuccess n

{-

We configure ghci to also output timing and memory info after the evaluation of every expression.

ghci> :set +s

Then we test the property.

ghci> quickCheckN 100000 $ insertPreservesSorted
*** Gave up! Passed only 55173 tests; 1000000 discarded tests.
(13.83 secs, 17,899,048,256 bytes)

This is somewhat better than above, but still very inefficient. It takes almost
14 seconds and tests only the ~5% of the generated tests.

This makes sense, as sorted is a scarce property. Only a small fraction of
randomly generated inputs will naturally have this characteristic. To make
things worse, most of the 55173 tests that are sorted will be very small, as the
probability of generating a sorted list decreases significantly as the list size
increases.

QuickChick lets us peek at the distribution of various properties of test cases
by providing a combinator called collect.

-- Collect will gather all values that are being passed to itm and will print out a histogram of the distribution of the values.
collect :: (Show a, Testable prop) => a -> prop -> Property collect

By using collect, we can group test cases based on a specific property (e.g.,
whether the list is sorted, its size, etc.) and observe their frequency during
testing. This helps identify potential biases in the test input distribution and
ensures that critical edge cases are adequately represented.

-}

insertPreservesSorted':: Integer -> [Integer] -> Property
insertPreservesSorted' x xs = isSorted xs ==> collect (length xs) $ isSorted (insert x xs)

{-

ghci> quickCheckN 100000 $ insertPreservesSorted'
ghci> quickCheckN 100000 $ insertPreservesSorted'
*** Gave up! Passed only 55399 tests; 1000000 discarded tests:
37.434% 0
36.295% 1
18.246% 2
 6.161% 3
 1.473% 4
 0.325% 5
 0.056% 6
 0.009% 7
 0.002% 8


Indeed, the vast majority of test cases (73.7%) have length 0 or 1. Less than 2% of the
test cases have a length more than 4.

So to test this property effectively we must write a fine-tuned generator for lists that only
generates sorted lists.

-}

{- Generators
   ----------

QuickCheck provides a library of generator combinators that lets us write our
own fine tuned generators.

Generators of a type a in QuickCheck have type Gen a. Gen is an instance of the
Monad type class which allows us to combine generators to build more complex ones.

-- Returns a constant generator
return :: a -> Gen a

- Generates an a and passes it to the second generator to generate a b
(>>=)  :: Gen a -> (a -> Gen a) -> Gen b

-}

{-

The Arbitrary Type Class
-----------------------

QuickCheck provides a class called Arbitrary for types that can be randomly generated.

It has two methods:

-- A generator for values of the given type.
arbitrary :: Gen a

-- Produces a (possibly) empty list of all the possible immediate shrinks of the given value.
shrink :: a -> [a]

What does the second method do?

Once a counterexample is found, QC can try to shrink the counterexample in order return a simpler
and more readable counterexample to the reader. It does so using the shrink function.

The default implementation returns the empty list, so will not try to shrink the value.

The Arbitrary type class is useful to write general functions over all type that have random generators.

For example we can write a naive generator for lists of type a.

-}

genList :: Arbitrary a => Gen [a]
genList = listOf arbitrary

{- We used the combinator

listOf :: Gen a -> Gen [a]

Its documentation says:

Generates a list of random length. The maximum length depends on the size
parameter.

What is this size parameter?

Internally, a QC generator receives two arguments: a random seed and a size
parameter. The size parameter can be used by a generator as an upper bound for
the size of the generated elements.

When running tests, QC will use increasingly larger size parameters.

In practice, it is vert common to write a generator that generates
elements of or up to a given size parameter and then use the combinator [sized]
internalize the size parameter.

-- Used to construct generators that depend on the size parameter.
sized :: (Int -> Gen a) -> Gen a

Using sized, we can write a primitive generator for list of a given type a.

-}

genList' :: Arbitrary a => Gen [a]
genList' = sized genListSize
  where
    -- generate a list of a certain length
    genListSize 0 = return []
    genListSize n = do
      x <- arbitrary
      xs <- genListSize (n-1)
      return $ x:xs

-- Note: List has already an arbitrary instance defined in QuickCheck. This is
-- just for demonstration purposes.

{-

Now we have all the necessary knowledge to define a generator for sorted lists.

We will use a couple more useful combinators.

Here's their type and documentation.

-- Generates a random element in the given inclusive range. For integral and enumerated types,
-- the specialized variants of choose below run much quicker.
choose :: Random a => (a, a) -> Gen a

-- Generates a random element over the natural range of a.
chooseAny :: Random a => Gen a

-- A fast implementation of choose for Integer.
chooseInteger :: (Integer, Integer) -> Gen Integer

You can find many more useful combinators here https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck-2.15.0.1/docs/Test-QuickCheck-Gen.html.


-}

-- Our sorted list generator is below.

genSorted :: Gen [Integer]
genSorted = do
    -- pick a lower bound
    lower <- arbitrary
    -- run aux with the lower bound and an arbitrary size
    sized $ aux lower
  where
    -- generates a random sorted list of length len whose first element is
    -- greater or equal to lower
    aux :: Integer -> Int -> Gen [Integer]
    aux _ 0 = return []
    aux lower len = do
      -- get a random positive range
      range <- (arbitrary :: Gen (Positive Integer))
      -- the upper bound is range + lower
      let upper = getPositive range + lower
      -- generate an element in the range [lower,range+lower]
      x <- chooseInteger (lower,upper)
      -- generate a sorted with length (len-1) whose first element is greater or equal to x
      xs <- aux x (len-1)
      -- return the list
      return $ x:xs

{-

We can try our generator out by using sample, a useful combinator that will run
the generator some times.

sample :: Show a => Gen a -> IO ()

ghci> sample genSorted

[]
[0,1]
[0,2,2,3]

-}

{-

Let's use it to test insert. We write a new property that uses the property
combinator forAll.

-- uses an explicitly given test case generator to test a property of type a -> prop
forAll :: (Show a, Testable prop) => Gen a -> (a -> prop) -> Property

You can find more useful property combinators here: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck-2.15.0.1/docs/Test-QuickCheck.html

We will also collect information about the "sortedness" and the length of test data.

-}

insertPreservesSorted'' :: Integer -> Property
insertPreservesSorted'' x =
    forAll genSorted (\l -> collect (isSorted l) $ collect (length l) $ isSorted (insert x l))


{-

ghci> quickCheck insertPreservesSorted''
+++ OK, passed 100 tests:
100% True
 1% 0
 1% 1
 1% 10
 1% 11
 1% 12
 1% 13
 ....
 1% 96
 1% 97
 1% 98
 1% 99

Now, not only our test cases are all sorted lists, but each one has a different length. We have achieved way better
test coverage than the previous property.

-}

{- Case study: Red-black Trees
   ---------------------------

TODO add more comments

Red-black invariant

- No path has two red nodes in a raw.
- Every path from the root to a leaf has the same number of black nodes. This is
  called the black height of the tree.

This invariant guarantees that every leaf is at least at most twice as deep as
any other leaf, which means that the heigh of any tree of N nodes is at most
2logN.

By convention the root of the tree is black.
