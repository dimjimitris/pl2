(** * A Small Introduction to The Coq Proof Assistant (I): Functional Programming with Proofs **)


(** Coq is a pure functional programming language and a theorem
    prover. Its underlying formal language is Calculus of Inductive
    Constructions (CiC) which is a dependently-typed, pure functional
    language with inductive types. This small but expressive language
    can be used to write purely functional programs, using a syntax
    similar to the ML family, express logical propositions, and write
    proofs. Coq can be used for:

    - Expressing and proving mathematical statements.

    - Developing functional programs and writing formal specifications
      of their behavior. Users can rigorously prove that these
      programs conform to their specifications.

    The proofs can be developed interactively and they are checked for
    validity by Coq's built-in proof checker.

    The core features of the language include:

    - (Recursive) functions and function application

    - Inductive types (a generalization of ML's algebraic data types)

    - Pattern matching on inductive types

    - Type polymorphism

    - Dependent types (we will learn more about dependent types later
      in this course)

    - Coinductive types (we will probably not cover these in this
      class)


    In this course we will use Coq extensively to model programming
    languages and study their properties. But before delving into
    this, we will first learn some basic usage.
*)


(** ** Coq Code Development and Execution *)

(** Coq files are commonly developed interactively, as we will do in
    the lectures. For this it is imperative to have an IDE with
    support for inteactive Coq development.

    Coq has also support batch compilation with the `coqc` command
    file `file.v` can also be compiled from the command line, using
    the command `coqc file.v`. This produces

    To execute Coq code, the Coq system provides extraction commands,
    that translate Coq code to a functional language (OCaml, Haskell
    or Scheme). This process erases proofs and all information that is
    not relevant for computation. The files then can be compiled and
    executed as normal OCaml/Haskell/Scheme files. This allows us to
    build software in Coq that comes with correctness proofs and
    extract it one of these languages. This software is commonly
    called [certified].

*)


(** ** Coq Types *)
    
(**  Coq has very few primitive types:

       - The function type: [->] or [forall _, _].
       - The type of types: [Type] and [Sort] as special case of [Type].
       - [Prop] the type of logical propositions

    Coq comes with an extensive #<a
    href="https://coq.inria.fr/doc/V8.19.0/stdlib/">standard
    library</a># that prodives common data structures (e.g., booleans, list, numbers, pairs, maps, and more).
    Î‘ll of these are not primitives but defined using inductive types. We will cover many of these in this lecture.

    Note: "Primitive Objects" including 63-bit machine integers and
    persistent arrays, have been added to recent versions Coq, be we
    will not cover them in this class. *)


(** *** Functions *)

(** At the heart of Coq's language we have functions.

    Let's define the identity function: a polymorphic function that
    takes as arguments a _type_ parameter [A], a parameter [x] of type
    [A] and returns [x].

    The [Definition] keyword allows us to declare a function or a
    constant. *) 

Definition id (A : Type) (x : A) : A := x.

(** Coq provides a number of useful commands to interact with the
    system. These are not expressions of the functional language but a
    way to communicate with the system. Some of these are [Check],
    [Print], [Compute], [Search] and others. We will use these
    extensively.

    [Check]: check the type of an expression
    [Print]: print a definition
    [Search]: find definition and lemmas in the current file or imported files whose name or type satisfies a number of conditions
    [Compute]: evaluate an expression

  Here we use [Check] to se the type of [id].

*)

Check id.

(** Prints:

[id : forall A : Type, A -> A]

*)

(** Functions can be applied to arguments. Since we haven't yet
    introduced any other types, lets try to apply [id] to a
    function. We choose to apply [id] to [id] itself.

    To do that we must first provide the type parameter, in this case
    [forall A : Type, A -> A], and then the parameter [id]. *)

Check (id (forall A : Type, A -> A) id).

(** We can also ask Coq to evaluate the application ... *)

Compute (id (forall A : Type, A -> A) id).

(** Prints:

[fun (A : Type) (x : A) => x
: forall A : Type, A -> A]

*)


(** ... and since the result is a type is a polymorphic function, we
    can apply it to arguments of different type. *)
 
Compute (id (forall A : Type, A -> A) id nat 3).

Compute (id (forall A : Type, A -> A) id bool true).

Compute (id (forall A : Type, A -> A) id (forall A : Type, A -> A) id).


(** Note: in languages like ML or OCaml this definition is not
    possible like this, as they only allow type quantification at the
    outermost position in the type of a definition (prenex
    polymorphism).  That is, type variables may not be instantiated
    with polymorphic types as we did above. Coq has a more expressive
    type system that let's us do this kind of thing. *)


(** We can also write anonymous function, using the syntax above. *)

Check (fun (A : Type) (x : A) => x).


(** Functions in Coq must be _total_. This means they must return an
    output of each element of their domain. They cannot loop forever
    or error out. This is important the for logical consistency of the
    system. We will revisit this concept again in the course. *)


(** **** Implicit Parameters*)

(** It is not always convenient to explicitly provide the type of the
    arguments. In many cases, these can be inferred by type inference.
    Coq lets us omit them either using an underscore, or by declaring
    in a definition that some arguments are implicit using curly
    braces [{ ... }].

    For example:
*)

Check (id _ (* Coq figures out this this argument is [nat] *) 3).


Definition id' {A : Type} (x : A) : A := x.

(** We don't have to provide a type argument for [id], [A] is implicit: *)
Check (id' 3).

(** Using the [@] symbol before a function's name, we can tell Coq to
    treat all arguments as explicit. *)
Check (@id' nat 3).


(** ** Proofs *)

(** Coq allows the development of mathematics proofs in an interactive
    way.

   During a proof we have a _goal_ that is the statement to be
   proved. We also have a _proof context_ that has premises that we
   know to be true at a certain point during the proof.

   Proof development in Coq is done through a language of so-called
   _tactics_. Tactics allow us to apply rules of logical reasoning to
   the goal and the proof context.

   Tactics construct an internal representation of the proof, called a
   _proof term_. This is then checked by Coq's proof checker for
   validity.  For now, we will treat this as a black box. *)

Lemma id_equality : 
  forall (A : Type) (x : A), id A x = x. 
Proof.
  (* The [intros] tactic moves universally quantified variables and
     and implications from the goal to the proof context. *)
  intros A x.

  unfold id. (* The [unfold id] tactic replaces [id] with its definition. *)

  reflexivity. (* [reflexivity proves a goal of the form [e = e], for some expression [e]. *)

  (* A complete proof ends with [Qed] which exits the interactive
     proof mode.  It stands for the Latin phrase "quod erat
     demonstrandum" which is tranditionally used in mathematical text
     to finish a proof. *)
Qed.

(** Now [id_equality] is a defined term and its type is exactly the statement we proved. *)
Check id_equality.

(** *** Skipping Parts of a Proof *) 

(** When developing large and complicated proofs, it is often
    convenient to assume some part of them to make progress and come
    back to them later. This can be done with the [admit] and [Admitted]
    keywords. *)
Lemma id_equality_admitted : 
  forall (A : Type) (x : A), id A x = x. 
Proof.
  intros A x.

  unfold id. (* replace [id] with its definition. *)

  admit. (* proves the goal! *)
  
  (* A proof with admitted or unfinished subproofs cannot be completed
     using [Qed].  It has to end with the keyword [Admitted] that
     assumes the current proof without it being finished. *)
Admitted.

(** An admitted proof can be used in other proofs to derive facts.
    Admitting proofs must be used with caution, as admitting an
    invalid statement makes the system inconsistent as using it we can
    derive other false statements. *)

(** ** Common Inductive Types *)

(** *** Booleans *)

(** We can also define _inductive types_, which are a generalization
    of ML's algebraic datatypes, and write functions that manipulate
    them. We will start by defining the boolean datatype.

    Note: Because Coq's standard library already includes these
    definitions, we put them in a seperate namespace that we create
    using a [Module]. After the end of the module, we can use these
    names to refer to the definitions in the standard library. *)

Module Bool.

(** The boolean data type is an inductive type with two
    constructors: [true] and [false] *)
Inductive bool : Type :=
| true : bool
| false : bool.

(** We can define functions that operate on this type. We define
    negation, conjunction and disjuntion.*)
Definition negb (x : bool) :=
  match x with
  | true => false
  | false => true
  end.

Definition andb (x y : bool) :=
  match x with
  | true => y
  | false => false
  end.

Definition orb (x y : bool) :=
  match x with
  | true => true
  | false => y
  end.

(** We can use such functions to perform computations on booleans. *)

Compute (negb true).

(** Prints:

[= false : bool]

*)

Compute (andb (orb false true) true).

(** Prints:

[= true : bool]

*)

(** Again, we can ask Coq what is the type of a definition: *)

Check true.

(** Prints:

[true : bool]

*)


Check andb.

(** Prints:

[andb : bool -> bool -> bool]

*)


(** We can also ask it to print a definition. *)

Print andb.

(** Coq allows us to define syntax extensions that modify the way Coq
    parses and prints objects. This can be done with the [NotationWe can use it to define familiar syntax
    for boolean operators. *)

Notation "x && y" := (andb x y) (at level 40, left associativity).
Notation "x || y" := (orb x y) (at level 50, left associativity).

(** We can ask Coq to give us information about a particular notation
    using the command [Locate]. *)

Locate "&&". 

Check (true || false).


(** Tip: Coq IDEs provide keybindings that allows us to quickly
    use [Print], [Check], [Search], and [Locate].


<<
           | VsCode + PG keybindings extension |        Emacs + PG
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Print  |       shift+ctrl+P                |    ctrl+c ctrl+a ctrl+p
    Check  |       shift+ctrl+S                |    ctrl+c ctrl+a ctrl+c
    Search |       shift+ctrl+K                |    ctrl+c ctrl+a ctrl+a
    Locate |       shift+ctrl+L                |    ctrl+c ctrl+a ctrl+l
>>

   You can modify these keybindings as you wish from your editors settings. *)


(** Crucially, we can prove facts about our definitions. *)

Lemma or_true_false :
  true || false = true.
Proof.

  (* The [simpl] tactic simplifies the goal. *) simpl.
  
  (* The reflexivity type proves an equality that has the same term on
     both sides *)
  reflexivity.
Qed.


(** Let's attempt to prove more interesting facts about booleans *)

Lemma de_morgan_law :
  forall (x y : bool), (* universal quantifier *)
    (negb x) && (negb y) = negb (x || y).
Proof.
  (* The [intros] tactic moves universally quantified variables and
     premises from the goal to the proof context. *)
  intros x y.

  (* We proceed by case analysis. We can do this with the tactic
     [destruct]. [destruct] will introduce two proof goals, one for
     when [x = true] and one for when [x = false]. *)
  destruct x.
  
  (* Case 1: x = true *)
  - (* This is a bullet. We use them to organize the proof script into
       cases. They are optional but are good practice in general. *)
    simpl. reflexivity.

  (* Case 2: x = false *)
  - simpl. reflexivity.

Qed.

(** Coq also has conditionals that can be used instead of pattern
    matching to write the above functions: *)

Definition orb' (b1:bool) (b2:bool) : bool := if b1 then true else b2.

(** Recall that [bool] is not a primitive type, The if-then-else
    construct is just syntactic sugar for pattern matching can be used
    to eliminate _any_ inductive type with exactly two constructors.
    The "then" branch is taken if the guard evaluates to the first
    constructor of the type and the "then" branch is taken if the
    guard is evaluated to the second constructor of the type. *)

End Bool.

(** *** Natural Numbers *)

(** We can represent numbers in a variety of ways, using different
    bases. Common examples binary (base-2) and decimal (base-10)
    representations.

    For example, we can use the [bool] datatype to define a binary
    number with a certain bit-width. *)

Inductive bin_num4 : Type :=
| Num : bool -> bool -> bool -> bool -> bin_num4.

(** [Num] is a constructor that takes 4 arguments and returns a
   [bin_num_4 ].  Its type is: *)

Check Num.

(** Prints:

[Num : bool -> bool -> bool -> bool -> bin_num4]

**)

(** We could also define operations on such numbers (e.g., addition,
    multiplication, etc). You can try this as an exercise at home.

    However, we would like a represetation for truly infinite
    mathematical numbers, and not numbers of certain bit width.

    We could define a datatype for infinite binary numbers, and such
    representations are included in Coq's stadard library.  Binary
    numbers, however, are a good way for representating numbers on a
    machine and performing operations on them with logical circuits.
    But when it comes to proofs, they are not a very convenient
    representation.

    We will use a representation that is simpler than binary numbers:
    unary numbers (base 1). That is, we will use a single digit to
    represent positive numbers. The idea is similar to counting using
    tally marks:
    
    I represents 1, II represents 2, Î™Î™Î™ represents 3, and so on.

    We can define this as an inductive type in Coq:

*)

Module Nat.
  
  Inductive nat :=
  | O : nat
  | S : nat -> nat.

  (** Intuitevely, the constructor [O] represents zero and [S] applied
      to any number represents the successor of this number.

      In mathematical language, we would describe the set of [nat]s as
      the smallest set that

      - [O] is in the set

      - if [n] is in the set then [S n] is in the set

     These are often called Peano numbers, as the mathematician Peano
     used this representation in his axiomatic formulation of natural
     numbers in the 19th century.

   *)

  Check (S (S (S (S O)))). (* Which number is this? *)
  
  (** Let's define some useful functions on natural numbers. *)

  (** The predecessor of a number *)
  Definition pred (n : nat) : nat :=
    match n with
    | O => O
    | S n => n end.

  (** A function that check if a number is zero *)
  Definition is_zero (n : nat) : bool :=
    match n with
    | O => true
    | S _ => false
    end.
  
  (** **** Recursion *)

  (** Since [nat] is a recursive datatype, we can define recursive functions on them.
      Recursive functions are defined using the [Fixpoint] keyword.
   *)
  
  (** Addition **)
  Fixpoint add (n1 n2 : nat) : nat := 
    match n1 with
    | O => n2
    | S n1' => S (add n1' n2)
    end.

  (** Subtraction **)
  Fixpoint sub (n1 n2 : nat) : nat :=
    match n1 with
    | O => O
    | S n1' => match n2 with
               | O => n1
               | S n2' => sub n1' n2'
               end
    end.

  (** We could also write this as: *)
  Fixpoint sub' (n1 n2 : nat) : nat :=
    match n1, n2 with
    | O, _ => O
    | _, O => n1
    | S n1', S n2' => sub' n1' n2'
    end.

  (** This is just syntactic sugar for nested pattern matching: *)
  Print sub'.
  
  (** Note that the argument to the recursive call of [add] is n1'
      which is structurally smaller than n1. The same is true for both
      arguments of the function [sub]. Coq requires that there is one
      argument that gets structurally smaller in each recursive call.
      This guarantees that all functions will terminate which is
      necessary for logical consistency.

      Such functions are called structurally recursive. Trying to
      define a non structurally recursive function with produce an
      error.

      Note: In Coq, there are ways to define generally recursive
      functions (that terminate but are not structurally recursive),
      but we will not see this at this course.  *)


  Fail Fixpoint test (n : nat) : nat :=
    match n with
    | O => O
    | _ => test (sub n (S (S O)))
    end.


  (** We can also define boolean equality on natural numbers *)
  Fixpoint eqb (n1 n2 : nat) : bool :=
    match n1, n2 with
    | O, O => true
    | S n1', S n2' => eqb n1' n2'
    | _, _ => false end.
  
End Nat.
  
(** From now on we will use the standard library's [nat], which is
    identical to our definiion above. **)

Print nat.
Print add.


(** Searching about [nat] will retrieve all the definitions (including
    theorems) that involving [nat]. This come quite handy in
    proofs. *)

Search nat.

(** Coq has defined notation for natural numbers that lets us use
    ordinary decimal notation for natural numbers and also notation
    for arithmetic operations. *)

Check 5.

Set Printing All.

Check 5.

Unset Printing All.

(** For all common operations on numbers, there is the usual notation
    defined in the standard library. *)
Locate "+".

Compute (4 + 5). 

(** We can now start proving properties for natural numbers and their
    operations. *)

(** Adding a number to zero is equal to the number. (Zero is the
    neutral element of addition) *)
Lemma add_O_n :
  forall n : nat, O + n = n.
Proof.
  intros n. simpl. reflexivity.
Qed.

(** Equality on natural numbers is transitive. *)
Lemma eq_transitive :
  forall x y z : nat,
    x = y -> y = z -> x = z.
Proof.
  intros x y z.

  intros Heq1 Heq2.

  (* The [rewrite] tactic allows us to replace a term with another, if
     we have a proof that they are equal.  For example, [rewrite Heq1]
     will replace the left-hand side of the equality [Heq1] with the
     right-hand side in the goal. *)
  rewrite Heq1.
  
  (* We can also replace the right-hand side of an equality with the
     left-hand side. We can use the annotation [<-] to denote the
     direction of the rewrite.
     
     For example, [rewrite <- Heq1] will replace the right-hand side
     of the equality [Heq1] with the left-hand side in the goal.

     Note: In this case, this will undo the previous rewrite, but it
     is only for demonstration purposes. *)
  rewrite <- Heq1.

  (* Rewrites can be applyed not only to the goal, but also to
     specific hypotheses in the context using the keyword [in].

     For example, [rewrite <- Heq1 in Heq2] will replace the
     right-hand side of the equality [Heq1] with the left-hand side in
     the hypothesis [Heq2]. *)
  rewrite <- Heq1 in Heq2.

  (* the [assumption] tactic allows us to derive a goal that is
     already an present as a hypothesis in the context. *)

(** Adding two equal numbers *)
Lemma add_eq_example:
  (* Coq has type inference, so it can figure out the types of
     variables [n1], [n2], [n3] and [n4], from the context they are
     used without us providing annotations. *) 
  forall n1 n2 n3 n4, 
    n1 = n2 -> n3 = n4 -> n1 + n3 = n2 + n4.
Proof.
  intros n1 n2 n3 n4 Heq1 Heq2.
  rewrite Heq1, Heq2.
  reflexivity.
Qed.

(** **** Injectivity and Distinctness of Constructors. *)

(** The constructors of natural numbers have some important properties:

    - If [S n = S m] then it must be [n = m]. (_injectivity_)

    - It cannot be that [S m = O]. (_distinctness_)

    These principles apply to all inductively defined types: all
    constructors are injective, and the values built from distinct
    constructors are never equal. Coq provides tactics that let us
    reason about these two facts.
*)

Lemma S_injective :
  forall n m,
    S n = S m -> n = m.
Proof.
  intros n m Heq.

  (* The [injection] tactic can be applied to a hypothesis of the form
     [C n_1 ... n_k = C m_1 ... n_k] and will reduce it to an
     hypothesis of the form [n_1 = m_1 /\ ... /\ n_k = m_k].  It can
     take a name to explicitly name the new hypotheses.  *)
  
  injection Heq as Heq'.
  assumption.
Qed.   

(** It is interesting to note that injectivity in not a primitive
    property that is encoded in the logic. It is a property that
    can be proved using the properties of equality.

    We could prove the above lemma primitively, without using
    injectivity, as shown below. The [injectivity] tactic does this
    for us so that we don't have prove a separate lemma for each
    constructor. *)

Lemma S_injective_prim :
  forall n m,
    S n = S m -> n = m.
Proof.
  intros n m Heq.

  (* applying a function to equal inputs yields the same output. *)
  assert (Heq' : pred (S n) = pred (S m)).
  { rewrite Heq. reflexivity. }

  simpl in Heq'. assumption.
Qed.



(** Constructors of inductive types are distinct, meaning that values
    constructed from different constructor must be different. This
    means that [S n = O] is an absurd In logic, we can prove anything
    from a false assumption. This is referred to as the principle of
    explosion or, in Latin, "Ex falso quodlibet".

    We can exploit disctinctness of constructors using the
    [discriminate] tactic, as reflected in the following lemmas. *)

Lemma O_eq_S_absurd :
  forall x, O = S x -> 3 = 4. 
Proof.
  intros x H.
  (* [discriminate] can be applied to a hypothesis of the form [C1 x_1 ... x_n = C2 y_1 ... y_m],
     where [C1] =/= [C2]. It will prove any goal. *)
  discriminate H.
Qed.

(** We can apply this principle to booleans as well (or any other inductive type). *)
Lemma true_eq_false_absurd :
  true = false -> 3 = 4. 
Proof.
  intros H.
  discriminate H.
Qed.


(** **** Boolean Equality. *)


(** It is important to note that the operator [=] will _not_ test
    natural numbers for equality. A statement of the form [x = y]
    simply states a _logical claim_. We can reason about its validity
    by doing a proof, like above, but we cannot compute its result.

    But it is normal to expect that there is a boolean equality
    operator. This is part of the library and it is called [eqb].
   
    As a simple exercise you can try defining [eqb] from scratch.  *)

Check eqb.

(** [n =? m] is a convenient notation for [eqb n m]. We can use Coq's
    locate command to print information about a notation. *)
Locate "=?".

(** As expected, we can use [=?] for computation *)

Compute (3 =? 3). 

Compute (4 =? 2). 

(** Let's prove that the successor of a number cannot be equal to
    zero. *)
Lemma succ_not_zero: forall n, 1 + n =? 0 = false.
Proof.
  (* Note: writing [1 + n] is the same (up to simplification) with writing [S n] *)
  intros n. simpl. reflexivity.
Qed.

(** **** Destructing Inductive Types *)

(** Let's now try to prove something similar *) 
Lemma add1_not_zero:
  forall n, n + 1 =? 0 = false.
Proof.
  (* Note: writing [n + 1] _does not_ simplify to [S n]. Can you see why? *)
  intros n. simpl.

  (* We proceed by considering cases for [n] *)

  (* Using destruct, will generate subgoals for each possible
     constructor case for a variable of an inductive type. Here it
     generates cases for when [n] is [O] and for when [n] is the
     successor of a number.  *)
  destruct n as [ | n'] eqn:Heq.

  - (* case [n = 0] *)
    simpl. reflexivity.
    
  - (* case [n = S n'] *)
    simpl. reflexivity.
    (* Note: [simpl] is not necessary here, as [reflexivity] will do
       it internally and succeed regardless of us using it first. This
       is true for other tactis as well. *)
Qed.


(** When we used destruct we used two extra annotations [[ | n' ]] and
    [eqn:Heq].

    The annotation [as [ l1 | l2 | ... | l_n ]] is called an
    _introduction pattern_.  Each [l_i] is a (possibly) empty list of
    variable names and it corresponds to each case of the destruct.
    Each variable list [l_i] specifies the names of the constructor
    arguments that corresponds to this case.
    
    If we don't specify any variable names, Coq will automatically
    pick some for us (that may not be the best choices). It is
    generally a good practice to give explicit names.

    In the previous proof, we used [[ | n' ]] that denotes that in the
    first subgoal we don't use any new variable names, since the [O]
    constructor doesn't take any arguments, and in the second subgoal
    we use n' for the argument of [S].

    The annotation [eqn:H] tells [destruct] to remember the equalities
    [n = 0] and [n = S n'] and put them in the context with the name
    [H]. In the first case, Coq will add [Heq : n = 0] to the proof
    context and in the second case it will add [Heq : n = S n'].
*)


(** In the previous proof we observe that [n + 0] does not directly
    simplify to [n]. Of course, it ought to be equal to it. Let's
    prove it once and for all, so we can use it in proofs.  (As you
    might expect, such statement is also part for the standard
    library.)  *)
  
Lemma add_n_O : forall n : nat, n + 0 = n.
Proof.

    (* [assert] let's us prove individual statements within a proof,
       and then puts the statement in the proof context with the

       to prove intermediate results during a proof. *) 
    assert (Heq' : n' + 0 = n').

      (* The tactic [admit] lets us "assume" some logical claim
         without proving it. It can be useful when constructing a
         complex proof with many different parts. However, in this
         case we cannot end the proof with [Qed]. We have to end it
         using the keyword [Admitted] that signifies that the
         statement is assumed rather than proved. We can also use the
         keyword [Abort] that aborts the current proof (without
         assuming the statement under proof. *)

(** But how can we prove that admitted statement? It seems that we
    need a more powerful reasoning principle to prove this fact.
    This principle is the _principle of induction_.
 *)

(** **** Proof by Induction *)

(** The induction principle over natural numbers says, informally,
    that if we can prove that a claim is valid for [0] and that if the
    claim's validity for a number implies that the claim is valid for
    its successor, then the claim ought to be valid for all natural
    numbers. Put more formally:

     If

     (1) [P(0)] holds

     (2) for any [n], if [P(n)] holds, then so does [P(n+1)]

     Then, for all [n], [P(n)] holds.

     Therefore, to show a goal of the form [forall n, P n], is
     suffices to show (1) and (2)

     Let's see this in practice.

Module Pairs.
  
  (** In Coq, and type theory in general, the type of a pair is called

  Inductive prod (A B : Type) : Type :=
  | pair : A -> B -> prod A B.

  Check prod.
  Check pair.

  (** In order to contruct pairs we call the [pair] contructor. The
      type tells us that we fist have to provide the types of the
      arguments and then the arguments.  *)

  Check (pair nat bool 42 true).
  

  (** Luckily, Coq has type inference that lets us elide the type
      arguments. We could write an underscore [_], and Coq would
      infer the type argument.  *)

  Check (pair _ _ 42 true).

  (** Prints:

  (** We can also tell Coq that the type arguments are impicit and can
      be elided.  *)

  Arguments pair {A} {B}.

  (** This allows us to write the less clunky: *)
  Check (pair 42 true).


  (** Now the type of pair has changed a bit: *)
  Check pair.

  (** We can still use the version with explicit type argument with
      the following notation: *)
  Check @pair.
  
  Check (@pair nat bool 42 true).  
  
  (** We again define convinient notations *)

  Notation "( x , y )" := (pair x y).
  Notation "A * B" := (prod A B) : type_scope.

  (** We also define the usual projection functions *)

  Definition fst {A B : Type} (x : A * B) : A :=

  (** Do you see any difference with the definition of lists and
      pairs?

      Similar to nat, list is inductively defined. A larger list is
      built from a smaller list with the constructor [cons]. The base

      Therefore we can write recursive functions on list and reason
      about lists with induction. *)
