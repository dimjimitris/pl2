(** * Pure Lambda Calculus **)


(** The lambda calculus (λ-calculus) is an abstract model of
    computation introduced by Alonzo Church in the 1930s. As a
    theoretical framework for computation, lambda calculus is
    Turing-complete, meaning it can model any computation that a
    Turing machine can perform (Turing, 1937).

    Modern functional programming languages have their roots in lambda
    calculus. Essentially, lambda calculus can be thought of as a
    minimalistic functional programming language, providing a
    foundation for studying the semantics and formal properties of
    functional programming languages.


    Lambda calculus is a formal language consisting of three main
    components:

    - Functions (or _lambda abstractions_): Functions are written as
      "λx. e", where "x" is a variable that is bound within the
      function body "e". A more familiar syntax for functions is ML's
      "fun x -> e"

    - Function Applications: Function application is written as "e1
      e2", where "e1" is applied to "e2".

    - Variables: Variables are typically denoted using elements of an
      countably infinite set. Here we will use strings.

    For example, consider the identity function applied to itself,
    written as: "(λx. x) (λx. x)".

   The syntax of lambda calculus can be defined by the following BNF
   grammar:

  term := λvar. term | term term | var

  with var ∈ {x, y, z, ... }

  Here we formalize the call-by-value and call-by-name semantics of
  lambda calculus, and we provide an proved-correct interpreter.
  Lastly, we build the AST of an untyped (for now) MiniML and we build
  and interpreter for it. *)

(** ** Pure Lambda Calculus: Syntax **)

(** The abstract syntax tree of lambda calculus. *)

Inductive term : Type :=
| App : term -> term -> term
| Lambda : string -> term -> term
| Var : string -> term.


(** Examples *)

Definition id : term := Lambda "x" (Var "x").

Definition app_id_id : term := App id id.

(** As usual, to make our lives slightly easier, we define some
    concrete syntax for lambda terms, using Coq's notations. *)

Declare Custom Entry LC.

Notation "<{ e }>" := e (e custom LC at level 99).
Notation "( x )" := x (in custom LC, x at level 99).
Notation "x" := x (in custom LC at level 0, x constr at level 0).
Notation "x y" := (App x y) (in custom LC at level 1, left associativity).
Notation "\ x , y" := (Lambda x y) (in custom LC at level 90,
                            x at level 99,
                            y custom LC at level 99,
                            left associativity).

(** Let's also define an implicit coercion to avoid writing the "Var"
    constructor in terms. *)

Coercion Var : string >-> term.

(** We define some commonly used variables. *)
Definition x : string := "x".
Definition y : string := "y".
Definition z : string := "z".

(** Examples, using notations *)

Definition id' : term := <{ \ x, x }>.

Definition app_id' : term := <{ id id }>.


(** ** Pure Lambda Calculus: CBV and CBN Semantics **)

(** To define the semantics we first formally define the substitution
    operation. We do not need to worry about making it explicitly
    capture avoiding: We only apply it to closed terms. Since CBV and
    CBN semantics do not evaluate under lambdas, and we only care
    about evaluating closed terms, substitution will never substitute
    open terms.

    Put more formally: CBV reduction preserves "closedness" of
    terms. *)

Fixpoint subst (x : string) (t' : term) (t : term) : term :=
  match t with
  | App t1 t2 => App (subst x t' t1) (subst x t' t2)
  | Lambda y t1 => if (x =? y)%string then Lambda y t1 else Lambda y (subst x t' t1)
  | Var y => if (x =? y)%string then t' else Var y
  end.

    the definition we have used in Imp.v. *)

  | multi_refl : forall a, multi R a a
  | multi_step : forall a b c,
    R a b ->
    multi R b c ->
    multi R a c.

(** *** Values **)

(** To define the evaluation strategy we need some notions of _value_.
    Value is a term that cannot be reduced any further. *)

Definition value (t : term) : bool :=
  match t with
  | Lambda _ _ => true
  | _ => false
  end.

(** We can now proceed to defining small step semantics that encode
    call-by-value and call-by-name evaluation strategies. *)
