## Repository contents
* `homework{01..06}/`: homework assignments using the Coq language. These assignments contain various proofs and algorithm implementation for type inference etc... of miniML. A simple ML-type language.
* `homework07/homework7/`: Haskell type-checker & interpreter for MiniML. Also, Haskell testing for these components.
* `homework08/`: Haskell type-inference for MiniML based on Algorithm W. We implement a simple version of algorithm W without most optimizations that have been added to it as it has aged. Constraint Generation rules and general algorithm structure has been adapted up to some point from 'Types and Programming' by Benjamin C. Pierce.
* `homework10/`: Rust implementation of a stack based virtual machine for MiniML; contains implementation of [Cheney's algorithm](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/362790.362798) for Garbage Collection.
